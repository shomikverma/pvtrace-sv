        scene: Scene
            The `Scene` to trace.
        ray: Ray
            The `Ray` to trace through the scene.
        maxsteps: int

            Abort ray tracing after ray has travelled more than this distance. Default
            is infinity.
        emit_method: str
            Either `'kT'`, `'redshift'` or `'full'`.

            `'kT'` option allowed emitted rays to have a wavelength
            within 3kT of the absorbed value.

            `'redshift'` option ensures the emitted ray has a longer of equal
            wavelength.

            `'full'` option samples the full emission spectrum allowing the emitted
            ray to take any value.
